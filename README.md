Deep Turtle
==========

Deep Turtle is a demonstration of Gingee's SDK.
It is free to download, use and refactor.

Use this as a case study for an AS3 casual game combining Gingee's SDK.
You can also use this project to make your own game by changing the assets.
"Deep Turtle" will easily build for iOS / Android / Blackberry / Desktops (Windows/OS X) / Web.
It is also cross resolution and will work seamlessly on tablets and smartphones with no extra optimizations or code changes.
This is all thanks to Gingee's cross platform solution.
